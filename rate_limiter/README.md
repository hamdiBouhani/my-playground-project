this example uses a simple token bucket algorithm. Here's an explanation of how the algorithm works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The rate limiter is initialized with a fixed "rate" (requests per second) and a "capacity" (bucket capacity) representing the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold.

2. **Token Update**:
   - At regular intervals (e.g., every second), the rate limiter updates the number of tokens in the bucket based on the rate.
   - Tokens are added to the bucket according to the rate. For example, if the rate is 5 requests per second, 5 tokens are added to the bucket every second.
   - The number of tokens is capped at the bucket's capacity to prevent exceeding the maximum capacity.

3. **Request Handling**:
   - When a request is received, the rate limiter checks if there are enough tokens in the bucket to allow the request.
   - If the bucket has at least 1 token, the request is allowed, and 1 token is consumed from the bucket.
   - If the bucket does not have enough tokens (less than 1), the request is denied.

4. **Token Consumption**:
   - Each allowed request consumes one token from the bucket.
   - If a request is denied due to insufficient tokens, no tokens are consumed.

5. **Delay between Requests**:
   - A delay is introduced between requests to simulate a real-world scenario where requests are not made instantly back-to-back.

In summary, the token bucket is refilled at a fixed rate, and requests are allowed if there are enough tokens in the bucket. This ensures that requests are processed at a controlled rate according to the specified limit. The token bucket algorithm is a popular approach for implementing rate limiting due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
