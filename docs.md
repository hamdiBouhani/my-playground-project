`SIGINT` is a signal in Unix-like operating systems that stands for "Signal Interrupt." It is typically sent by the terminal to interrupt a running process. When a process receives the `SIGINT` signal, it's a request to terminate the process gracefully.

In Golang, you can handle `SIGINT` to perform specific actions or cleanup when the user interrupts the program (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+C`). You would usually handle the `SIGINT` signal using a signal handler.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to handle `SIGINT` in a Golang program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
)

func main() {
	// Create a channel to receive signals
	sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)

	// Register the channel to receive SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
	signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

	fmt.Println("Press Ctrl+C to exit...")

	// Block until a signal is received
	<-sigChan

	// Handle the signal (perform cleanup, etc.)
	fmt.Println("Received SIGINT. Shutting down gracefully.")
	// Perform cleanup or any actions needed before exiting

	// Exit the program
	os.Exit(0)
}
```

In this example:
- We create a channel (`sigChan`) to receive signals.
- We use `signal.Notify` to register the channel to receive `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals.
- We use `<-sigChan` to block the program until a signal is received.
- When a signal (e.g., `SIGINT`) is received, the program prints a message and performs any necessary cleanup before exiting.

Compile and run this program, and you can terminate it gracefully by pressing `Ctrl+C`, which sends the `SIGINT` signal to the program.
